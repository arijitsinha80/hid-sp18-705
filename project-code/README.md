# Demo of BigchainDB's Role-Based Access Control Extension

The BigchainDB repository has been added here as a submodule. When
cloning the repository, include the `--recursive` switch to ensure that the
submodule contents are cloned as well, or run `git submodule update --init
--recursive` if the repository has already been cloned.

```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/hid-sp18-705.git
$ cd hid-sp18-705/project-code/bigchaindb/
$ make run
```

Executing `make run` will launch three Docker containers, one for each
component of BigchainDB (BigchainDB Server, Tendermint, and MongoDB).
Several seconds after starting up, BigchainDB will be ready to process
transactions.

Once stopped, the containers can be reset with `make reset`.

Once the containers are running, the Python script `rbac_demo.py` in
the `demo` directory can the be executed and will send a series of 
transactions to the BigchainDB server.
